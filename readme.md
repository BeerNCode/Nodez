# Nodez

Guess what. It's another game!

## Getting Started

Download and install python. Pip install stuff. Crack on.

## The Game

The year is 20PE. A team of budding engineers have discovered a free supply of power on the planet Narahrhf. Unfortunately, nothing in this world is free, and two competeing companies have discovered the energy and are vying for sole control of the source.

You play an engineer, working for one of the companies. You must keep the source connected to your beacon in order to extract the power. You do this by placing link nodes between the source and your beacon, which transfer the energy across.

Link nodes that are closer together, transfer energy between each other quicker, and so the shortest route with the most nodes in it, is the fastest way to extract the power!

## Controls

Each player in the game controls an engineer, and can move up, down, left and right. To pick up a node, press the action key when your engineer doesn't already have one picked up. If you currently have a node, the action key will place it.
